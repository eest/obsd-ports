* Steps needed to start the dsc collector:
    * Edit the following settings in /etc/dsc/dsc.conf:
        * local_address
        * run_dir
        * interface

    * Create the directory mentioned in "run_dir" above:
        # mkdir $(awk -F\" '/^run_dir/{print $2}' /etc/dsc/dsc.conf)

    * At this point you can start dsc via rc.d, it will start writing XML files to your "run_dir".

* Steps needed to start uploading the XML files to a presenter:
    * Come up with a name for your presenter, this example will use the name "presenter".

    * Create an upload directory inside "run_dir" with a directory named after the presenter:
        # mkdir -p $(awk -F\" '/^run_dir/{print $2}' /etc/dsc/dsc.conf)/upload/presenter

    * Enable the upload-prep.pl script:
        # echo "* * * * * root /usr/local/libexec/dsc/upload-prep.pl" >> /etc/crontab

    * Decide how to get the files to your presenter:
        * Sending files from the collector can be accomplished using the scripts in ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/dsc/.
        * Pulling files from the presenter is left to the reader to implement.
