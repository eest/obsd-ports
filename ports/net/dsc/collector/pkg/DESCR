This is the collector part of DSC (DNS Statistics Collector).  It
listens for DNS traffic on a network interface and records statistics.
The collector can run on the DNS server itself our on another host
listening via a port mirror.

The resulting XML files can be parsed by the DSC presenter available as
a few scripts from the same source this package is built from.
